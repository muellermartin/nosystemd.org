=============

This website is currently built using plain HTML. Currently there is only one file: `index.html`.

There is also a Python script to check links for their availability (server down or link results in 404 etc.).

The easiest way to run this script is via `pipenv`:

1. `pipenv install`
2. Optional: `pipenv run checklinks` to check for dead links
